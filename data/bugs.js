    'Most moths are nocturnal but seem to be attracted to light (for example, a porch light or a fire).',
    'One reason is that because moths are nocturnal, they navigate, or find their way around by using the moon as a point of reference. Moths can become confused by any other light source and they basically get "lost". As a result, they typically stay where they are, making it look like they are attracted to the light.'
